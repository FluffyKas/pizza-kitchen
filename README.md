# Frontend Mentor - Interactive rating component solution

This is a solution to the [Interactive rating component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

I actually expanded upon it a bit. You could say this is a completely different project >.< I hope whoever designed the challenge will forgive me.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

<!-- This project started out as a newbie level Frontend Mentor challenge. I wanted to practice React and a small component such as this one felt like a commitment I can make >.< By the end of it, I felt bad though because I didn't feel like I learned anything so I decided to add a few bits.

First, a pizza-creation function. Then a Contact form to practice form handling. At this point, I had to add routing as well. And then I enjoyed forms so much (and the CSS I came up with for it >.<) that I wanted to use it elsewhere. So I added login and signup option. For this I had to look up authentication and Firebase, as I knew nothing about these things. Then I reused my dark/light theme toggle from a previous project and implemented it here with this project colours. Then I decided it would make the most sense, if the actual rating card / thank you card components were transformed into modals only.

So yes. The original idea ended up being some tiny popup in a somewhat bigger website.

Disclaimer: I'm not a designer, nor am I aiming to be very good at it right now. This is just some pet project to practice React. And I'm sorry if it hurts the eyes >.< -->

In Progress

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Sass
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

### What I learned

<!-- - Framer Motion
- context
- useState vs useRef
- input handling
- routing, useNavigate()
- Firebase
- modals with react - surprisingly easy
  (will add more once the version 1 of this project is done) -->
